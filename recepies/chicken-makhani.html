    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Chicken Makhani, also known as Butter Chicken, is a rich and creamy Indian
      dish made with marinated chicken cooked in a spiced tomato gravy. It's
      typically served with naan or rice. This butter chicken recipe, or chicken
      makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored
      sauce that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy
      as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan
      bread.
